#### Final Project for COMP 561 - Computational Biology Methods and Research at McGill University.

#### Report Introduction:

“Genes are rarely about inevitability, especially when it comes to humans, the brain, or behavior. They're
 about vulnerability, propensities, tendencies.”
 ― Robert M Sapolsky, Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers
 
Elusive and mysterious, the Felidae family has been roaming this planet for longer than humans. Their lineage is diverse, and sprawls all continents and habitats. This report presents a phylogenetic study of three protein-coding genes present in the family’s species today: MT-COX1, MT-COX2, and MT-COX3. These genes are at the heart of the production of cytochrome c oxidase, an enzyme essential for breathing in all mammalian species. In this project, ancestral reconstructions of all three genes were generated. These were then analyzed to uncover the mysteries behind their evolution through time, and more importantly their adaptations to various environments.
In this report, some background information is first presented. This section notably introduces the Felidae family, cytochrome c oxidase and its role in mammals, and the gathering of nucleotide sequences for phylogenetic study. From there, the methodologies behind ancestral reconstruction and sequence comparison are outlined. The results produced by these methods are then displayed, interpreted and discussed.
